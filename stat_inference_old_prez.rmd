Let’s pick the discussion on statistical inference from the last statement of Mr. Bullet
According to him, fresh graduates in the last five years from Department of Economics will start their job with at least 30000 Taka
means nothing, zero, starting point
here is
Starting average salary of an economics graduate from university of Dhaka is 30000 Taka
How to prove it?

Hypothesis Testing
Ideal method to test Bullet’s Hypothesis
Find and track all the economics graduates from DU economics in the last five years department and find their starting salary
That’s kind of prohibitive due to time and financial constraint.
Practical Solution?
Collect a sample
How to collect sample?
Bullet goes to his Facebook friend and collect data from his seniors who recently passed.
Let’s say he contacted 10 such person and found out that their average salary is 35000 Taka.
Does it prove it the null hypothesis , , is correct?
Bullet’s sample is biased so the result coming out of it is also biased.
Now biased towards what?
First the way sample is collected.
There is a strong possibility that senior students Bullet knows and contacted are goods students like him.
So naturally they have higher average income than what usually economics student have
It is positively biased
Average income is higher than what it should be.
Other problems with Bullet’s method
Sample size of 10 might be too low
What’s the optimal sample size?
These are all topics of sampling theory
How to collect sample
Each of the person in the sample should have equal chance of getting selected
The way sample is collected each of the students who passed economics department in the last five years should have equal probability of getting into the sample
Guess what was the problem with Bullet’s sample!
In Bullet’s sample, each person did not have equal probability of getting selected
Only those who are in his friend list had the chance to be included.
Those who were not in the friend list had zero probability of getting selected.
Then what’s the ideal way to collect a sample?
Random sampling
Simple Random Sampling
Get a list of all the students who passed economics department of university of Dhaka in the last five years.
Randomly pick a certain number of students from them like they do in lottery
Again the “certain number” is important, for now, we assume, it’s 1000

Statistical Inference: Part 4
Dr. Rushad Faridi
Department of Economics
University of Dhaka
Two Types of Statistical Error
Type I
Type II
Type I error
Rejecting null when it is true
Type II error
Not rejecting null when it is false
We will try to minimize the Type I error.
Why?
Suppose we are talking about a murder trial
Innocent until proven guilty
Null: person is innocent
Alt: person is guilty
Null: person is innocent
Alt : person is guilty
Rejecting null when it is true
Meaning rejecting the person is innocent when s/he is actually innocent and then sentencing him/her to death.
This is much more fatal error than the other scenario
Not rejecting Null when it is false
Null: person is innocent
Alt : person is guilty
Equivalent to setting a guilty man free
So we minimize the Type I error
Again Type I error is “rejecting null when it is true”.
What do we mean by “minimizing” Type I error?
It means setting a level of type I error which is tolerable.
In statistical analysis it is standard to tolerate 5% probability of type I error.
This “probability of Type I error” has a name
It’s called “level of significance”
Expressed by the Greek letter
When we say it means
level of significance is 5%, which means
Probability of making type I error is 5%
It’s okay if out of 100 times, 5 times we reject the null when it is actually true.
It might not be okay in judiciary . It would be quite disgraceful to hang 1 innocent people in every 100 verdict, let alone 5.
Since the consequence of Type I error in statistics is not as fatal as judiciary, 5% error is acceptable.
In the next video lecture we will continue our discussion and we have to remember our final destination.
We want to know whether Bullet’s claim on average salary of DU economics graduates (at least 30000 Taka) is right or wrong.


We need to have a critical value of salary based on which we will reject or will not reject null.
We said the concept of error will help us to achieve that
From the discussion of error, we learned about , the level of significance
How does help to determine that critical value of salary?
Before going into that we will have a quick review of probability distribution which is critical for rest of the process.
This is a very quick review on Probability Distribution.
Normal distribution is one such probability distribution.
Most of the time we assume data is normally distributed.
Even though population is not normally distributed, sampling distribution is normally distributed by Central Limit Theorem.
