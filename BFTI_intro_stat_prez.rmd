# Quiz question no 1

Suppose in my last semester’s statistics class was attended my 120 students. Average score in the final was 70 with
a variance of 25. What does this particular value of variance mean? 

--

(a) On the average, each student scored 25
squared points more or less than the average score of 70 points. 

(b) On the average, each student scored 25 points
more or less than the average score of 70 points. 

(c) Each student scored 25 squared points more than the average
score of 70 points. 

(d) The score of each student varies by 25 points. 

(e) None of the above

## Statistics 

* Science of collecting, organizing and analyzing numerical data 

* Two types: 

* Descriptive statistics 
    - mean, median, variance, standard deviation etc
* Inferential statistics 
    - Hypothesis testing, confidence interval

---

## What is variance? 

* Why it is important to know? 

* Variance is some sort of average variability in bunch of numbers

$$Var(x_i)= \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}$$

---

### Variance in exam score

* If the variance is high, that means students' performance is variable. 
* Their learning ability was not uniform

### Variance in business sales

Variance in business sales is high: 
* means sales are consistent, some times high some time very low. 
* High variance in stock price: means risky asset

---

## Variance in theory

* It is the average variability in a bunch of numbers 

* To find average, you need to have the total or sum 

* So we need to find first the total variability

* Total variability can be written as follows: 

$$\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

---

Suppose I have five numbers

84, 65, 95, 92, 73

We first to find the average 

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum(x_i)}{n}$$

```{r}
scores <- c(84, 65, 95, 92, 73)
mean(scores)
(scores-mean(scores))^2
(total.var <- sum((scores-mean(scores))^2))
(variance <- total.var/(length(scores)-1))
var(scores)
```

The average of the above five scores is `r mean(scores)`

The total variability can be calculated as 

$$\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

and the value is `r total.var`

---

## Three questions

$$Var(x_i)= \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}$$

* Why do we need to deduct $\bar{x}$ ? 

* If we deduct, then why we need to square it? 

* Why do we need to divide it by $n-1$

## Why do we need to deduct $\bar{x}$ ? 

$$Var(x_i)= \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}$$

$\bar{x}$ is a measure of central tendency, a representative value 

We want to know, on the average, how much each student vary from the representative value

But `mean` is not always the best way to find the `representative` value

---

## Why `mean` is not always the best measure

Consider the following five numbers

`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`


```{r, include = FALSE}
mean5 <- mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

The average of the above five numbers is `r mean5`

Now thing about the following five numbers

`1, 2, 3, 4, 500`


```{r, include = FALSE}
mean500 <- mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 500))
```

The average of the above five numbers is `r mean500`

###  What has gone  wrong here? 

---
template: center-slide

`Mean` is a poor estimate of central/representative value  when values include outliers

`Median` is a better measurement if data have outliers


`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

`1, 2, 3, 4, 500`

`Median` in both cases is the same, therefore `median` is a robust estimator of central value

---
template: center-slide

Why mean is still used? 

It is easily understood and has nice mathematical properties. 

There are many cases where `mean` makes sense but not `median`

---

## If we deduct mean, then why we need to square the value? 

$$Var(x_i)= \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}$$

Why this?

$$\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$
$$=(x_1 -\bar{x})^2+(x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + \ldots + (x_n - \bar{x})^2$$

Why not this? 

$$\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \bar{x})}$$
$$=(x_1 -\bar{x})+(x_2 - \bar{x}) + \ldots + (x_n - \bar{x})$$

This is because, the sum of deviations is zero

---

template: center-slide

## Then why not take `absolute value`? 

--

### Absolute value is very unweildly to work with 

--

### Mathematically very cumbersome to find statistical properties of an estimator

--

### That is finally we settle down on squared deviations as the best option

---

template: center-slide

## Why do we need to divide it by $n-1$  

Something to do with `degree of freedom`

### E is in trouble 
     * E can not just choose any number 
     * E needs to keep in mind that average has to be 3
     * E can not but choose 1
     

???
She now has to consider the fact that she will have to choose the numbers such a way that average of five numbers is 3. 
She figures that sum of those will have to be 15 to have an average of 3. She does not have any freedom to choose any number. 
She will have to choose 1. 

--- 

* E can not just choose any number 

* E's choice of number depends on what what others have chosen before

* Therefore, E can not but choose 1

###  While calculating varinace we need to know the mean value before hand.

###  Therefore, we lose one degree of freedom.

###  A parameter required both variance and mean in its formula: lost 2 degrees of freedom

varied more than that of secion A students. 

(b) Score of section A students is more consistent compared to section
B students. 

(c) Average score is a poorer representive value in section B compared to in section A.

Suppose in my last semester’s statistics class was attended my 120 students. Average score in the final was 70 with
a standard deviation of 5. What does this particular value of standard deviation imply? 

(a) On the average, each
student scored 5 squared points more or less than the average score of 70 points. 

(b) On the average, each student
scored 5 points more or less than the average score of 70 points. 

(c) Each student scored 5 squared points more
than the average score of 70 points. 

(d) All of the above 

(e) None of the above

## What is standard deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of variance

Why we need to square root the variance? 

To get back to the original unit

In the above example the unit of variance is `point square` 

So we can say, the variance is `r variance` point square

$$SD(x_i)=\sqrt{ \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}}$$

When transformed to `standard deviation`, the unit is back to `point`

```{r, include=F}
sd.score <- sqrt(variance)
```

Therefore, we can say the standard deviation is `r round(sd.score,1)` points

## Statistical inference 

Find the average income of an household in Dhaka Metropolitan City

Suppose there are 40,000 households 

It is not possible to go to each households
Time consuming 
Expensive

Collect Sample 

Sampling design theory says 5000 household will be representative of 40,000 

Population is 40,000 and 5000 is sample 

Since we are estimating from a sample, there is considerable bit of uncertainty. 

Anything uncertain, in statistics we deal with probability. 

That's why we need to learn  about probability theory
